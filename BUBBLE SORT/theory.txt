In each pass the nth maximum element goes to the right position.
If there are n elements , then we require atmost n-1 passes to sort.
ALGORITHM : 
In each pass swap two adjacent elements if arr[i] > arr[j] .
Iteration in each pass also reduced.
TIME COMPLEXITY for bubble sort is O(n*n).
SPACE COMPLEXITY for bubble sort is O(1).
Bubble Sort is a Stable Sort because it maintain order for same elements.
