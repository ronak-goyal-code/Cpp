vector is replacement of array.
problem of array is of fixed size but vector gives flexibility of change size according to requirement.
vector is dynamic array.
header file is used for vector is #include<vector>
basic operation on vectors are push_back() , pop_back , size() , capacity() at , sort.
by pop_back() function only size change but capacity does not change.
if vector is full then by push_back() operation capacity of vector become twice and size is increased by 1.
vector is pass by value. each time you pass new array is created.
